    <h2>Summary</h2>

    google-drive-ftp-adater-online is an open source project. It is a web application allowing you to connect your ftp
    client to your Google Drive account. This website offers that web application as an ONLINE FREE SERVICE available
    publicly on Internet. The only aim of this website is to provide a NON-PROFIT free service. Your personal data WON'T
    NEVER BE SHARED TO THIRD PARTIES. The Service is offered from GERMANY data center. The COLLECTED DATA from you
    includes:
    <ul>
        <li>EMAIL</LI>
        <li>GOOGLE DRIVE AUTHORIZATION TOKEN</li>
        <li>LIST OF YOUR GOOGLE DRIVE FILES</li>
        <li>FTP USER</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We use your email for 2 reasons: As a username to login to the website and only if needed, as a way to
        communicate about any issue concerning the application like changes to this privacy policy or security
        information. Your email will be never used to send you spam or any commercial data. You will have the right to
        delete completely your account including all your personal data by sending an email to
        ftpdrive@andresoviedo.org.</p>
    <p>The Google Drive Authorization Token (this is not your google username or password) is a file containing a String
        allowing the application to connect to your Google Drive account on your behalf. At any time you will have the
        option (a button) to revoke this authorization yourself in the application.
    <p>
    <p>The list of your google drive files is only a list of file names. It means that if you have a file named
        "your-picture.jpg" or any other file, the application will save into the application's database the path and the
        name of that file (e.g. "/your-folder-name/your-picture.jpg"), but it wil never store the picture itself or any
        binary content. The only purpose of having this list stored in the database is for perfomance reasons to provide
        the functionality of this service. This information will only be downloaded to application's database the first
        time you connect your ftp client to the Service. You will have the option to delete completely this data by
        sending an email to ftpdrive@andresoviedo.org
    <p>
    <p>The FTP user is a user you create yourself in the application to allow FTP clients to connect to your
        google-drive-ftp-adapter-online account, therefore to your Google Drive account. You will have the option ( a
        button) to delete this user yourself at any time. It is your reponsability to manage that user. We don't assume
        any responsability derived from the misuse of the FTP user.</p>
    <p>If you register and you don't use the ftp service for a period of 1 year your data will be deleted. An email will
        be sent to you prior to deletion. You will have the option to respond to this email with a consent to mantain
        your data for 1 more year.</p>
    <p>This Service is free and mantained with no financial support. The Service could be unavailable at any time.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy please send an email to ftpdrive@andresoviedo.org.</p>
